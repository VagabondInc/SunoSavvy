ANALYSIS OF PLATFORM WAV CONVERSION &amp;amp; OUR ENHANCEMENT PROCESSWe proved the Suno&#39;s WAV is a dressed-up MP3 — then built something better.I knew we had to grab the .WAV files for your songs but the time it takes on Suno is a pain in the ass so, it got me thinking, why does it take so long on Suno in the first place? It&#39;s not because they have to summon the magical .WAV fairies from a distant .WAV warehouse to go fetch your .WAV&#39;s. It&#39;s because they&#39;re taking the MP3 and turning it into a .WAV, and if you know anything about audio, that&#39;s not good. MP3&#39;s are compressed and they lose a lot of data. Anything above 16,000 Hz is pretty much gone forever. Suno did try to make it seem like they&#39;re giving you a quality .WAV file, but it&#39;s artificial and not even artificial intelligence. I can&#39;t blame them though because most other platforms that offer .WAV downloads do the exact same thing. So it&#39;s not new. If you&#39;ve downloaded a .WAV from Suno, then you know the size difference is pretty drastic. For them to store 45 billion 75mb files is a lot different than storing 45 billion 3mb files. So instead of scratching my head or beating it against the wall, trying to download all of the songs in the Suno .WAV format, I figured we could do it better than Suno. And that&#39;s exactly what we did! The image above is the original MP3 file downloaded from Suno. Below, are the two images of the resampled .WAV&#39;s. The one on the left is Suno&#39;s, and the one on the right, is our .WAV file. You can see how much cleaner ours is above the 16,000 Hz shelf. Don&#39;t believe me? Try for yourself. These Spectrogram sweeps showed Suno&#39;s “WAV” stops cold at ~16 kHz, then overlays faint synthetic highs to fake resolution. We rebuilt the pipeline so the highs are real, not painted on. Signal Analysis: Compared MP3 vs. WAV spectrograms and confirmed identical base data with a 16 kHz shelf. Warp-Fill Reconstruction: Used an algorithm that &quot;Healed&quot; the 12–16 kHz harmonics upward with adaptive smoothing to 20 kHz performed in the STFT domain with phase mapping. Precision Mastering: Ran the restored file through one of the best open source mastering tools, Matchering, and we use a genre-tuned fine tuned sample as our reference to master the track to -14 LUFS, the standard for streaming platforms like Spotify. QA &amp;amp; Delivery: Normalized loudness, kept true 48 kHz / 16-bit fidelity, and validated the new spectrum and enhanced the psychoacoustic feel. Result: the SunoSavvy WAV restores authentic “psychoacoustic feel,” maintains stereo depth, and outperforms Suno’s pseudo-WAV in both spectral integrity and perception.ProvenanceProvenance is important to prove ownership, and now that all major platforms are rolling out AI guardrails, disclosure and ownership is an important step to be taken seriously and to maintain your catalogs integrity. So not only do you get all your tracks, you also get a provenance bundle. It contains (For each track): A public JSON-LD record for the track (schema.org/MusicRecording) with a clear AI-use disclosure plus checksums and a provenance URL—searchable, linkable, and future-proof. Embedded WAV/BWF metadata (inside the master WAV): bext (Description, Originator, OriginatorReference, dates, CodingHistory, optional UMID, loudness fields), iXML (NOTE, FILE_UID), and optional aXML/EBUCore with structured human/AI roles and a pointer to your provenance page. MP3/ID3 credits mapped to standard frames (TIT2, TPE1, TALB, TSRC, etc.) plus short COMM and TXXXfields for AI_Involvement, Provenance_URL, and toolchain—so distributors and players can read it. Cryptographic integrity proofs: file SHA-256 for each deliverable, audio-stream SHA-256 (container-agnostic) for MP3/MP4/WAV, and BWF audio-data MD5 inside the WAV. These let anyone confirm “same audio” even after remuxing. Reproducible loudness notes (LUFS/LRA/True Peak) using EBU R128 loudnorm, captured in the sidecar and shown on the page. Immutable storage IDs: S3 Object-Lock VersionID for each master and optional IPFS CIDv1—published on the track page. Platform-ready disclosure blurbs (Spotify/DistroKid, Bandcamp, YouTube, SoundCloud) that mirror the above in plain language. Why this is important Compliance &amp;amp; trust: Streaming platforms are rolling out AI-use disclosures and spam filters; clear credits + structured fields help you avoid false positives and keep releases live. Chain-of-custody: Hashes (file + stream) and the embedded BWF MD5 give you verifiable lineage across re-encodes, remuxes, and distributor pipelines. Reproducibility: Publishing how loudness was measured makes QC disagreements boring—anyone can re-run the command and match the numbers. Immutability: S3 Object Lock and IPFS CIDs make your “golden master” a fixed point in time; if anything changes, the IDs change. That’s tamper-evidence for your catalog. DDEX-friendly metadata hygiene: Using standard chunks/frames (bext/iXML/aXML; ID3) means distributors, archivists, and search engines can actually consume your credits and disclosures. TL;DR Why SunoSavvy?Because you deserve to keep what you create, and to hear it in its truest form. In the current turbulent climate of the AI music world, nothing feels guaranteed. Platforms rise fast and disappear just as quickly, and I’d hate for what happened to so many UDIO users to ever happen again. All that work, emotion, time, and creative energy... gone overnight.That’s why I built SunoSavvy. It’s not just a downloader. It’s a safeguard for your art. It restores clarity, depth, and detail Suno compress away, giving you full-quality masters you actually own.Our hearts are with you, UDIO users. I can’t imagine how that felt. I’m just sorry I didn’t release this sooner." property="og:description">

So not only do you get all your tracks, you also get a provenance bundle. It contains (For each track):</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>A public JSON-LD record</strong> for the track (<a href="http://schema.org/MusicRecording" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">schema.org/MusicRecording</a>) with a clear AI-use disclosure plus checksums and a provenance URL—searchable, linkable, and future-proof.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Embedded WAV/BWF metadata</strong> (inside the master WAV): bext (Description, Originator, OriginatorReference, dates, CodingHistory, optional UMID, loudness fields), <strong>iXML</strong> (NOTE, FILE_UID), and optional <strong>aXML/EBUCore</strong> with structured human/AI roles and a pointer to your provenance page.     </li>
<li>
<strong>MP3/ID3 credits</strong> mapped to standard frames (TIT2, TPE1, TALB, TSRC, etc.) plus short <strong>COMM</strong> and <strong>TXXX</strong>fields for AI_Involvement, Provenance_URL, and toolchain—so distributors and players can read it.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Cryptographic integrity proofs</strong>: file SHA-256 for each deliverable, <strong>audio-stream SHA-256</strong> (container-agnostic) for MP3/MP4/WAV, and <strong>BWF audio-data MD5</strong> inside the WAV. These let anyone confirm “same audio” even after remuxing.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Reproducible loudness notes</strong> (LUFS/LRA/True Peak) using EBU R128 loudnorm, captured in the sidecar and shown on the page. </li>
<li>
<strong>Immutable storage IDs</strong>: S3 Object-Lock <strong>VersionID</strong> for each master and optional <strong>IPFS CIDv1</strong>—published on the track page.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Platform-ready disclosure blurbs</strong> (Spotify/DistroKid, Bandcamp, YouTube, SoundCloud) that mirror the above in plain language.   </li>
</ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Why this is important</strong></h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>Compliance &amp; trust</strong>: Streaming platforms are rolling out AI-use disclosures and spam filters; clear credits + structured fields help you avoid false positives and keep releases live.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Chain-of-custody</strong>: Hashes (file + stream) and the embedded BWF MD5 give you verifiable lineage across re-encodes, remuxes, and distributor pipelines.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Reproducibility</strong>: Publishing how loudness was measured makes QC disagreements boring—anyone can re-run the command and match the numbers. </li>
<li>
<strong>Immutability</strong>: S3 Object Lock and IPFS CIDs make your “golden master” a fixed point in time; if anything changes, the IDs change. That’s tamper-evidence for your catalog.   </li>
<li>
<strong>DDEX-friendly metadata hygiene</strong>: Using standard chunks/frames (bext/iXML/aXML; ID3) means distributors, archivists, and search engines can actually consume your credits and disclosures.   </li>

It's not because they have to summon the magical .WAV fairies from a distant .WAV warehouse to go fetch your .WAV's. It's because they're taking the MP3 and turning it into a .WAV, and if you know anything about audio, that's not good. MP3's are compressed and they lose a lot of data. Anything above 16,000 Hz is pretty much gone forever. Suno did try to make it seem like they're giving you a quality .WAV file, but it's artificial and not even artificial intelligence. I can't blame them though because most other platforms that offer .WAV downloads do the exact same thing. So it's not new. If you've downloaded a .WAV from Suno, then you know the size difference is pretty drastic. For them to store 45 billion 75mb files is a lot different than storing 45 billion 3mb files. So instead of scratching my head or beating it against the wall, trying to download all of the songs in the Suno .WAV format, I figured we could do it better than Suno. And that's exactly what we did! The image above is the original MP3 file downloaded from Suno. Below, are the two images of the resampled .WAV's. The one on the left is Suno's, and the one on the right, is our .WAV file. You can see how much cleaner ours is above the 16,000 Hz shelf. Don't believe me? Try for yourself. These Spectrogram sweeps showed Suno's “WAV” stops cold at ~16 kHz, then overlays faint synthetic highs to fake resolution. We rebuilt the pipeline so the highs are real, not painted on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSignal Analysis:\u003c/strong\u003e Compared MP3 vs. WAV spectrograms and confirmed identical base data with a 16 kHz shelf.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWarp-Fill Reconstruction:\u003c/strong\u003e Used an algorithm that \"Healed\" the 12–16 kHz harmonics upward with adaptive smoothing to 20 kHz performed in the STFT domain with phase mapping.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePrecision Mastering:\u003c/strong\u003e Ran the restored file through one of the best open source mastering tools, Matchering, and we use a genre-tuned fine tuned sample as our reference to master the track to -14 LUFS, the standard for streaming platforms like Spotify.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQA \u0026amp; Delivery:\u003c/strong\u003e Normalized loudness, kept true 48 kHz / 16-bit fidelity, and validated the new spectrum and enhanced the \u003cstrong\u003epsychoacoustic feel.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eResult: the SunoSavvy WAV restores authentic “\u003cstrong\u003epsychoacoustic feel\u003c/strong\u003e,” maintains stereo depth, and outperforms Suno’s pseudo-WAV in both spectral integrity and perception.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://public-files.gumroad.com/i2wznbh2coye9ar5fmhizgysms5q\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"figcaption\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch1\u003eProvenance\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cp\u003eProvenance is important to prove ownership, and now that all major platforms are rolling out AI guardrails, disclosure and ownership is an important step to be taken seriously and to maintain your catalogs integrity.
